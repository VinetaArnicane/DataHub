# About DataHub Compliance Forms
<FeatureAvailability/>

**DataHub Compliance Forms** simplify the process of documenting, annotating, and classifying your data assets while ensuring accountability by assigning tasks to the appropriate data owners, stewards, and subject matter experts.

With flexible configurations, Compliance Forms empower teams to ask the right questions to the right people for a targeted set of assets, streamlining compliance and governance workflows.

## What are DataHub Compliance Forms?

Think of **Compliance Forms** as structured surveys for your data assets: a series of questions that must be answered to ensure an asset meets your documentation and classification standards.

Key Features:

* **Configurable Questions:** Tailor Forms to collect exactly the information you need.
* **Targeted Assignments:** Direct specific questions about specific data assets to relevant stakeholders.
* **Verification Workflow:** Use Verification Forms to require a final review and sign-off for all responses, ensuring assets are fully verified. This adds an extra layer of accountability, critical for compliance and governance programs.
* **Compliance Readiness:** Track and enforce documentation standards across assets.

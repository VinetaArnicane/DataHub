# Complete a DataHub Compliance Form
<FeatureAvailability/>

## Viewing a Compliance Form

Once you have been assigned to complete a Complaince Form, you will see a **Complete Documentation** or **Complete Verification** option on the right-hand side of an Asset Page:

<p align="center">
  <img style="box-shadow: 0px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);" 
       width="70%"  
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/refs/heads/main/imgs/compliance_forms/completion/complete-task-from-asset-page.png"
       alt="Open Compliance Form from Asset Page"/>
</p>

Alternately, if you are using DataHub Cloud, you can find all outstanding Compliance Forms requests assigned to you by navigating to the **Task Center**:

<p align="center">
  <img style="box-shadow: 0px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);" 
       width="80%"  
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/refs/heads/main/imgs/compliance_forms/completion/complete-tasks-from-task-center.png"
       alt="Open Compliance Form from Task Center"/>
</p>

### Example: **Governance Initiative 2024** Form

Let's use the following **Governance Initiative 2024** as an example, which has 3 Required Questions:

<p align="center">

       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/refs/heads/main/imgs/compliance_forms/sample-compliance-form.png" 
       alt="Sample Compliance Form"/>
</p>

**_1. What is the primary use case for this asset?_**

This required Question is asking the Assignee to provide Documentation on how the Asset should be used. Note that there is no text populated in the description, meaning the Assest does not have any docuumenation at all.

<p align="center">
  <img
       width="90%"
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/refs/heads/main/imgs/compliance_forms/completion/complete-task-incomplete-question.png"
       alt="Sample Compliance Form"/>
</p>

**_2. When will this asset be deleted?_**

You may notice that this question has a pre-populated value. When metadata has been populated from a source _outside_ of a Form, users will have the option to update and save the value, or simply **Confirm** that the value is accurate.

<p align="center">
  <img
       width="90%"
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/refs/heads/main/imgs/compliance_forms/completion/complete-task-confirm-value.png"
       alt="Sample Compliance Form"/>
</p>

**_3. Who is the Data Steward of this Asset?_**

Here's an example where another Form Assignee has already provided an answer through the Compliance Form 3 days ago. Assignees will still have the option to update/change the response, but this allows users to see how other Form Assignees have already answered the questions.

<p align="center">
  <img
       width="90%"
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/refs/heads/main/imgs/compliance_forms/completion/complete-task-question-answered.png"
       alt="Sample Compliance Form"/>
</p>



If you or another assignee have completed a Question from the Form, you will see the

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

**Why can't I complete a Compliance Form for an Asset?**

Forms can be assigned to Asset Owners, specific DataHub Users, or a combination of the two. Please confirm with the Form author that your DataHub user is in-scope for the Form.

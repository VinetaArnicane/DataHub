# How Acryl DataHub compares to DataHub

DataHub is the #1 open source metadata platform for developers.
Acryl DataHub takes DataHub to the next level by offering features that allow
you to roll out the product to the entire organization beyond your central data
platform team.

We’ve organized this comparison using a few categories:
* Search and Discovery: the ability to discover data assets at your organization and understand relationships between them
* Data Governance: features that help you govern the crown jewels of your organization, and trim out the datasets that seem to grow like weeds when no one’s looking
* Data Quality: features that help you ensure your data pipelines are producing high quality assets, and if they’re not, you’re the first to know
* Enterprise Grade: features needed to roll out at scale to large enterprises
* Implementation and Support: features related to ease of deployment and maintenance

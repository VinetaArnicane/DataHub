# v0.1.37

This release includes a fix for timeouts in reindexing of large indices that occurs when new fields are added to an index.

## What's New

* Getting Started Modal + Empty State: Improve the experience of having no data ingested in DataHub by providing a "Getting Started" Guide when there is no data yet ingested.
* Provide BigQuery credentials via recipe config: Previously BigQuery credentials were provided via environment variable. Going forward they can be provided directly inside the Recipe config.

## Fixes

1. Increase re-indexing 30s timeout: Previously elastic reindexing was maxed at a 30 second synchronous timeout. This was causing some upgrades of GMS to fail. This PR increases that timeout to one hour.

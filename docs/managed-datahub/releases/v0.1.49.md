# v0.1.49

## Release Highlights

#### Notable UI-Based Features

**Quickly view, search, and filter the downstream dependencies of any Entity!** By using the Impact Analysis Lineage view, you can now see the full set of downstream entities that may be impacted by a change to a given entity. You can also search, filter, and export the list of entities to CSV; try it for yourself [here](https://demo.datahubproject.io/dataset/urn:li:dataset:\(urn:li:dataPlatform:snowflake,demo\_pipeline.public.all\_entities,PROD\)/Lineage?is\_lineage\_mode=false).

**View Dataset- and Column-Level Data Validation outcomes in DataHub.** We now support surfacing outcomes from [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/) validations in Dataset Entities! Easily view the full history of validation outcomes to understand the trustworthiness of your data.

**User Groups, Policies, and Tags have a new look!**

The User Group page has a new look, allowing you to assign an email address, Slack Channel, Group Owner, and more. Easily add/remove Group Members from the UI - test it out [here](https://demo.datahubproject.io/group/urn:li:corpGroup:DataHub%20Core%20Team/members).\
We refreshed the [Policies Page](https://demo.datahubproject.io/policies), allowing you to see Policy membership and status at a glance.\
The Tag Details page has been overhauled! You can now edit the definition, assigned owners, and tag color via the UI (try it [here](https://demo.datahubproject.io/tag/urn:li:tag:Legacy)).

**Search for datasets by proposed Tags and Glossary Terms!** You can now search by proposed Tags and Glossary Terms to see which datasets have that Tag or Glossary Term proposed!

**See satisfied constraints in the UI!** Satisfied constraints now show up in the UI and will display a description of which Glossary Term satisfied it and whether it comes from the dataset or container level.

#### Notable Metadata Model & Ingestion-Based Features

**First Milestone: Column-Level Lineage is complete!** The Metadata Model now supports “fine-grained” lineage for Datasets; see documentation [here](https://datahubproject.io/docs/generated/metamodel/entities/dataset/#fine-grained-lineage) for details, including adding fine-grained lineage to a dataset or a datajob.

**Define Dataset-to-Dataset lineage via YAML.** As demonstrated in the [February 2022 Town Hall](https://youtu.be/enBqB2Dbuv4?t=1234), you can now set Dataset-level lineage via YAML. This is great for teams that have more bespoke lineage needs that cannot be auto-extracted by the current set of supported ingestion sources.

**Track all changes to entities using the Timeline API.** This unified timeline of changes to entities in the metadata graph provides a robust picture of how your metadata has evolved over time. Upcoming work will support surfacing this detail via the DataHub UI. See the overview from Town Hall [here](https://youtu.be/enBqB2Dbuv4?t=717).

**Miscellaneous Metadata Ingestion Updates:**

Incubating: PowerBI Ingestion Source\
BigQuery Profiling: ability to disable profiling by partition\
Tableau improvements: Workbooks are now modeled as “Containers”

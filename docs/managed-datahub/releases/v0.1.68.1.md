# v0.1.68.1

### Features

* Performance improvements of lineage tab

### Notable Changes

* The format of browse paths has changed. Existing browse paths may render with an additional folder to click through. Ingestion connectors are actively being upgraded to produce the new format. As they are upgraded, this issue will resolve itself.

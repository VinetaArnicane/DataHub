# Tags

### Prerequisites&#x20;

To add & remove Tags certain [access policies](policies-guide.md) are required.&#x20;

#### Privileges for Adding & Removing Tags&#x20;

The following **Metadata** privileges are required for adding or removing an existing Tag to a resource (dataset, chart, dashboard):&#x20;

* **Edit Tags** - Allows the user to add tags at the entity level.
* **Edit Dataset Column Tags** - Allows users to add tags at the dataset column (schema) level.

The following privileges pertain to tag proposals. Please see the [Proposals usage guide](proposals.md) for more details.

* **Propose Tags** - Allows the user to propose tags at the Entity level.
* **Propose Dataset Column Tags** - Allows users to propose tags at the dataset column (schema) level.



Tags are metadata that can be added datasets, dataset schema, or containers. They provide an easy way to label or categorize entities.&#x20;

### Adding a Tag

To add a tag at the dataset or container level, simply navigate to the page for that entity and click on the "Add Tag" button.

You can then type in the name of the tag you would like to add. You can either add a tag that already exists, or add a new tag entirely. The autocomplete will pull up the tag if it already exists.

If you would like to add a tag at the schema level, hover over the "Tags" column for a schema until the "Add Tag" button shows up, and then follow the same flow as above.

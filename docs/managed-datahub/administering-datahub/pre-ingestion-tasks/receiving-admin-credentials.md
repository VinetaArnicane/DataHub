# Receiving Admin Credentials

In the established communications channel, the Acryl integrations team will provide you the following:

1. Your Acryl instance URL (https://your-domain-name.acryl.io)&#x20;
2. Admin account credentials for logging into the DataHub UI&#x20;

Once you have these, you're ready to log in.

- Product

  - **Search Bar**: Introducing a brand new search bar experience with sleeker designs, more functionality such as filtering, and consistent results with what users expect compared to search page results.
  - **Proposals**: We're excited to announce our redesigned proposals experience is now live! We've refreshed both the interface for reviewing proposals sent to you as well as viewing your own proposals.
  - **Glossary**: This release enhances our Business Glossary with improved scaling capabilities, ensuring support for glossaries of any size. We've also made several UX improvements, including a new search bar when browsing Terms within a Term Group.

- Ingestion
  - #13397 - Ingestion Rest Emitter - Added EmitMode parameter for write guarantees (>= 1.0.0.4)
     - SYNC_WAIT: Synchronously updates the primary storage (SQL) but asynchronously updates search storage (Elasticsearch). Provides a balance between consistency and performance. Suitable for updates that need to be immediately reflected in direct entity retrievals but where search index consistency can be slightly delayed.
     - SYNC_PRIMARY: Synchronously updates the primary storage (SQL) but asynchronously updates search storage (Elasticsearch). Provides a balance between consistency and performance. Suitable for updates that need to be immediately reflected in direct entity retrievals but where search index consistency can be slightly delayed.
     - ASYNC: Queues the metadata change for asynchronous processing and returns immediately. The client continues execution without waiting for the change to be fully processed. Best for high-throughput scenarios where eventual consistency is acceptable.
     - ASYNC_WAIT: Queues the metadata change asynchronously but blocks until confirmation that the write has been fully persisted. More efficient than fully synchronous operations due to backend parallelization and batching while still providing strong consistency guarantees. Useful when you need confirmation of successful persistence without sacrificing performance.

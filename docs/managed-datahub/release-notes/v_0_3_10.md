- Bug Fixes
  - 

- Product

  - Our new simplified nav bar is now switched on by default in the V2 UI
  - Links in the documentation tab are now fully editable and can be displayed in page headers and search results. We've also added an `upsertLink` GraphQL endpoint for easier programmatic management of links.
  - Entity profile pages now display the new proposal types: Ownership, Domains, and Structured Properties.
  - Our redesigned proposals experience (Proposals 2.0) is now in beta! Try out the improved interface for viewing proposals you can approve/decline as well as those that you've created.

- Observe
  - Introducing on-demand smart assertions! This means you can create freshness, volume, and field metric anomaly detection checks on-demand, for any table that's supported by Observe.
  - Smart assertion tuning: Improve your anomaly monitors by adjusting training data lookback window, tightening or loosening the sensitivity, and adding data-point exclusion windows.
  - Incidents V2: Incidents have received a significant uplift! With capabilities to set assignees, severity, stage, and impacted assets.

- Platform
  - OpenAPI: API Tracing improvements (Experimental)
  - Graphql: Sorting added to `scrollAcrossEntities`
  - Performance: Improved access policy performance when using nested domains and containers
  - OpenAPI: Operation endpoints created to fetch raw ES documents and view kafka lag on MCP and MCL topics
  - OpenAPI: Additional validation for URNs and entity/aspect names when using async endpoints
  - OpenAPI: Fixed timeseries aspect ingestion bug #12912
  - RestoreIndices: Support added for read-only replicas

- Ingestion 
  - MLflow: Support dataset â†” run lineage with customizable platform mapping for datasets.
  - OpenAPI: Ingestion can use OpenAPI instead of Rest.li, set environment variable `DATAHUB_REST_SINK_DEFAULT_ENDPOINT=OPENAPI`

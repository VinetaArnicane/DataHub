Release Availability Date
---
TBD

Recommended CLI/SDK
---
- `v0.13.3.4` with release notes at https://github.com/acryldata/datahub/releases/tag/v0.13.3.4

If you are using an older CLI/SDK version, then please upgrade it. This applies for all CLI/SDK usages, if you are using it through your terminal, GitHub Actions, Airflow, in Python SDK somewhere, Java SDK, etc. This is a strong recommendation to upgrade, as we keep on pushing fixes in the CLI, and it helps us support you better.

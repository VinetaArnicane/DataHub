- Breaking Changes

- Bug Fixes
  - Fix a few inaccuracies in the Compliance Forms analytics tab - handle multiple forms per asset properly and fix a few bugs in the forms analytics ingestion source when generating this analytics data.
  - Fix bug in nested select component when adding a Domain question to your Compliance Form when selecting child domains. Now you can properly select a parent and their children.

  - Fix order of parent entity paths in the autocomplete dropdown for a given result.
  - Fix broken display name for Groups when downloading search results.

  - Fix dropdowns for selecting platforms and other filters when creating Views that were not showing any results.
  - Fix lineage counts on search result cards that were incorrectly counting "ghost" (non-existent) entities.

- Product
  - Introducing the new stats tab redesign for Datasets and Columns! This release gives you all the functionality you had with Dataset and Columns stats previously, but now in a much cleaner, more consumable way. We also add a few new stats and charts to render additional helpful information about your assets.
  - Improve the Compliance Forms experience while filling out questions by pre-filling responses for the user with existing metadata on the asset. Now, a user will have an even easier time filling out Compliance Forms for their assets.
  - Improve the new navigation bar experience by centering and expanding the search bar at the top of the page.
  - Add validator to prevent duplicate question IDs across and within Compliance Forms.

- Platform

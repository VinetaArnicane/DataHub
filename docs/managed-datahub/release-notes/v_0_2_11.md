---

Release Availability Date
---
12-Sep-2023

Recommended CLI/SDK
---
- `v0.11.0` with release notes at https://github.com/acryldata/datahub/releases/tag/v0.10.5.5
- [Deprecation] In LDAP ingestor, the manager_pagination_enabled changed to general pagination_enabled

If you are using an older CLI/SDK version then please upgrade it. This applies for all CLI/SDK usages, if you are using it through your terminal, github actions, airflow, in python SDK somewhere, Java SKD etc. This is a strong recommendation to upgrade as we keep on pushing fixes in the CLI and it helps us support you better.

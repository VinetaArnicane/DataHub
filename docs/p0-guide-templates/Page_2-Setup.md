# DataHub [Source Name] UI Ingestion Guide: Setup & Prerequesites

<!-- In order to configure ingestion from [Source], you'll first have to ensure some basic prequesites are met -->

## [Source Name] Prerequesites
<!-- This section should provide plain-language instructions on any permissions/configuration need to occur in the Source:

* What special permissions are required, if any? 
* Screenshots of [Source] UI
* Are there any API keys or passwords to be noted down, or authentication flows that need to be executed?
* Screenshots of [Source] UI
* Are there any Project, Client, or User ID's that need to be copied down?
* Screenshots of [Source] UI
* What sort of data needs to exist in the source so that we confirm the ingestion was successful in DataHub?
* Screenshots of [Source] UI
* Note down an asset from [Source] that we can later search for in DataHub to validate your ingestion

-->

## Next Steps
<!-- Once you've confirmed all of the above in [Source], it's time to move on to configuring the actual ingestion source within the DataHub UI -->

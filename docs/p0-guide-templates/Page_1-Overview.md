# DataHub [Source Name] UI Ingestion Guide: Overview


## What You Will Get Out of This Guide
<!-- 
* This guide is for ingestion through the DataHub UI, not for CLI (command line interface) ingestion
* You will have learned how to set up the [Source] connector using the DataHub UI
* At the end of this guide, you will have extracted [Entities Connector Extracts] from [Source] into your DataHub instance, and set up a recurring link between [Source] and DataHub.
 -->

:::caution
You will NOT have extracted [Excepted Entities] from [Source], as the connector does not support ingesting these assets

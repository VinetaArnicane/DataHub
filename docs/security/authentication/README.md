# Authentication & Authorization

Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service, and authorization determines their access rights within a system.
This section is all about how DataHub authenticates & authorizes a given user/service that wants to interact with the system.

## Authentication

Authentication can be split into 2 main components:
 - How to login into DataHub.
 - How to make some action withing DataHub on behalf of a user/service.

:::note

Authentication in DataHub does not necessarily mean that the user/service being authenticated will be part of the metadata graph within DataHub itself other concepts like Datasets or Dashboards.
In other words, a user called `john.smith` logging into DataHub does not mean that john.smith appears as a CorpUser Entity within DataHub.

For a quick video on that subject, have a look at our video on [DataHub Basics â€” Users, Groups, & Authentication 101

### Authentication in the Frontend

Authentication in DataHub happens at 2 possible moments, if enabled.

The first happens in the **DataHub Frontend** component when you access the UI.
You will be prompted with a login screen, upon which you must supply a username/password combo or OIDC login to access DataHub's UI.
This is typical scenario for a human interacting with DataHub.

DataHub provides 2 methods of authentication:
 - [JaaS Authentication](../../how/auth/jaas.md) for simple deployments where authenticated users are part of some known list.
 - [OIDC Authentication](../../how/auth/sso/configure-oidc-react.md) to delegate authentication responsibility to third party systems like Okta or Google/Azure Authentication. This is the recommended approach for production systems.

Upon validation of a user's credentials through one of these authentication systems, DataHub will generate a unique token that represents the session and all subsequent requests will be made in that session's behalf.

### Authentication in the Backend

The second way in which authentication occurs, is within DataHub's Backend (GMS) when a user makes a request either through the UI or through APIs.
In this case DataHub makes use of Personal Access Tokens or session HTTP headers to apply actions on behalf of some user.
To learn more about GMS authentication have a look at our docs on [Introducing Metadata Service Authentication](introducing-metadata-service-authentication.md).

Note, while authentication can happen on both the frontend or backend components of DataHub, they are separate, related processes.
The first is to authenticate users/services by a third party system (Open-ID connect or Java based authentication) and the latter to only permit identified requests to be accepted by DataHub via access tokens or bearer cookies.

If you only want some users to interact with DataHub's UI, enable authentication in the Frontend and manage who is allowed either through JaaS or OIDC login methods.
If you want users to be able to access DataHub's backend directly without going through the UI in an authenticated manner, then enable authentication in the backend and generate access tokens for them.

## Authorization
Once the identity of a user or service has been established, DataHub determines what accesses the authenticated request has.

This is done by checking what operation a given user/service wants to perform within DataHub & whether it is allowed to do so.
The set of operations that are allowed in DataHub are what we call **Policies**.

Policies specify fine-grain access control for _who_ can do _what_ to _which_ resources, for more details on the set of Policies that DataHub provides please see the [Policies Guide](../../policies.md).

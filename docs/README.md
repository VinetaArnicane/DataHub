# DataHub Docs Overview

DataHub's project documentation is hosted at [datahubproject.io](https://datahubproject.io/docs)

## Types of Documentation

### Feature Guide

A Feature Guide should follow the Feature Guide Template, and should provide the following value:

* At a high level, what is the concept/feature within DataHub?
* Why is the feature useful?
* What are the common use cases of the feature?
* What are the simple steps one needs to take to use the feature?

When creating a Feature Guide, please remember to:

* Provide plain-language descriptions for both technical and non-technical readers
* Avoid using industry jargon, abbreviations, or acryonyms
* Provide descriptive screenshots, links out to relevant YouTube videos, and any other relevant resources
* Provide links out to Tutorials for advanced use cases

*Not all Feature Guides will require a Tutorial.*

### Tutorial

A Tutorial is meant to provide very specific steps to accomplish complex workflows and advanced use cases that are out of scope of a Feature Guide.

Tutorials should be written to accomodate the targeted persona, i.e. Developer, Admin, End-User, etc.

*Not all Tutorials require an associated Feature Guide.*

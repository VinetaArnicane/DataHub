# UI Tabs Guide

Some of the tabs in the UI might not be enabled by default. This guide is supposed to tell Admins of DataHub how to enable those UI tabs.

## Stats and Queries Tab in Datasets

To enable these tabs you need to use one of the usage sources which gets the relevant metadata from your sources and ingests them into DataHub. These usage sources are listed under other sources which support them e.g. [Snowflake source](../../metadata-ingestion/source_docs/snowflake.md), [BigQuery source](../../metadata-ingestion/source_docs/bigquery.md)

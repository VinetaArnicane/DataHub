# Which DataHub API is for me?

DataHub supplys several APIs to manipulate metadata on the platform:
- The [GraphQL API](docs/api/graphql/getting-started.md) is our recommended option for querying and manipulating the DataHub graph. 
- We offer an [OpenAPI](docs/api/openapi/openapi-usage-guide.md) schema defining the REST API used by our SDKs.
- The [Rest.li API](docs/api/restli/restli-overview.md) is a much more powerful, low level API intended only for advanced users. 

## GraphQL API

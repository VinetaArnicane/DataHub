# Getting Started

## Introduction to OpenAPI - What And Why

The OpenAPI standard is a widely used documentation and design approach for APIs. Historically, we have published our RESTful APIs
under the Rest.li standard that is used internally by LinkedIn that we inherited from the beginning of the project.

Rest.li is a very opinionated framework that has not seen wide adoption in the Open Source community, so users are often unfamiliar
with the best ways to interact with these endpoints. To make it easier to integrate with DataHub, we are publishing an OpenAPI based set of endpoints.

## Using DataHub's OpenAPI - Where and How

Currently, the OpenAPI endpoints are isolated to a servlet on GMS and are automatically deployed with a GMS server.
The servlet includes auto-generation of an OpenAPI UI, also known as Swagger, which is available at `<GMS-server-host>:<GMS-port>/openapi/swagger-ui/index.html`.
This is also exposed through DataHub frontend as a proxy with the same endpoint, but GMS host and port replaced with DataHub frontend's url 
and is available in the top right dropdown under the user profile picture as a link. Note that it is possible to get
the raw json or yaml formats of the OpenAPI spec by navigating to `<baseUrl>/openapi/v3/api-docs` or `<baseUrl>/openapi/v3/api-docs.yaml`.
The raw forms can be fed into codegen systems to generate client side code in the language of your choice that support OpenAPI format. We have noticed varying
degrees of maturity with different languages in these codegen systems so some may require customizations to be fully compatible.

The OpenAPI UI includes explorable schemas for request and response objects that are fully documented. The models used
in the OpenAPI UI are all autogenerated at build time from the PDL models to JSON Schema compatible Java Models.

Programmatic usage of the models can be done through the Java Rest Emitter which includes the generated models. A minimal
Java project for emitting to the OpenAPI endpoints would need the following dependencies (gradle format):

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.acryl:datahub-client:<DATAHUB_CLIENT_VERSION>'
    implementation 'org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:<APACHE_HTTP_CLIENT_VERSION>'
    implementation 'org.apache.httpcomponents:httpasyncclient:<APACHE_ASYNC_CLIENT_VERSION>'
}
```

and would construct a list of `UpsertAspectRequest`s to emit:

```java
import io.datahubproject.openapi.generated.DatasetProperties;
import datahub.client.rest.RestEmitter;
import datahub.event.UpsertAspectRequest;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;


public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
    RestEmitter emitter = RestEmitter.createWithDefaults();

    List<UpsertAspectRequest> requests = new ArrayList<>();
    UpsertAspectRequest upsertAspectRequest = UpsertAspectRequest.builder()
        .entityType("dataset")
        .entityUrn("urn:li:dataset:(urn:li:dataPlatform:bigquery,my-project.my-other-dataset.user-table,PROD)")
        .aspect(new DatasetProperties().description("This is the canonical User profile dataset"))
        .build();
    UpsertAspectRequest upsertAspectRequest2 = UpsertAspectRequest.builder()
        .entityType("dataset")
        .entityUrn("urn:li:dataset:(urn:li:dataPlatform:bigquery,my-project.another-dataset.user-table,PROD)")
        .aspect(new DatasetProperties().description("This is the canonical User profile dataset 2"))
        .build();
    requests.add(upsertAspectRequest);
    requests.add(upsertAspectRequest2);
    System.out.println(emitter.emit(requests, null).get());
    System.exit(0);
  }
}
```

# Adding or Replacing Custom Properties on Datasets

## Why Would You Add or Replace Custom Properties to Datasets? 
Adding custom properties to datasets can help to provide additional information about the data that is not readily available in the standard metadata fields. Custom properties can be used to describe specific attributes of the data, such as the units of measurement used, the date range covered, or the geographical region the data pertains to. This can be particularly helpful when working with large and complex datasets, where additional context can help to ensure that the data is being used correctly and effectively.

DataHub models custom properties of a Dataset as a map of key-value pairs of strings.

Custom properties can also be used to enable advanced search and discovery capabilities, by allowing users to filter and sort datasets based on specific attributes. This can help users to quickly find and access the data they need, without having to manually review large numbers of datasets.

### When to Add or Replace

There may be situations where it is more appropriate to replace existing custom properties on a dataset, rather than simply adding new ones.


### Goal Of This Guide
This guide will show you how to add or replace custom properties on dataset `fct_users_deleted`.


## Prerequisites
For this tutorial, you need to deploy DataHub Quickstart and ingest sample data. 
For detailed steps, please refer to [Prepare Local DataHub Environment](/docs/api/tutorials/references/prepare-datahub.md).

:::note
Before adding custom properties, you need to ensure the target dataset is already present in your DataHub instance. 
If you attempt to manipulate entities that do not exist, your operation will fail.
In this guide, we will be using data from sample ingestion.
:::

In this example, we will add some custom properties `cluster_name` and `retention_time` to the dataset `fct_users_deleted`.

## Add Custom Properties With Java SDK
The following code adds custom properties `cluster_name` and `retention_time` to a dataset named `fct_users_deleted` without affecting existing properties.

```java
{{ inline /metadata-integration/java/examples/src/main/java/io/datahubproject/examples/DatasetCustomProperties.java }}
```

For more information, please refer to [dataset_add_documentation.py](https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/blob/master/metadata-ingestion/examples/library/dataset_add_documentation.py)

## Add Custom Properties With Python SDK
Following code add a description and link to a dataset named `fct_users_deleted`.
For more information, please refer to [dataset_add_documentation.py](https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/blob/master/metadata-ingestion/examples/library/dataset_add_documentation.py)

    log.info(f"Documentation added to dataset {dataset_urn}")

else:
    log.info("Documentation already exists and is identical, omitting write")


current_institutional_memory = graph.get_aspect(
    entity_urn=dataset_urn, aspect_type=InstitutionalMemoryClass
)

need_write = False

if current_institutional_memory:
    if link_to_add not in [x.url for x in current_institutional_memory.elements]:
        current_institutional_memory.elements.append(institutional_memory_element)
        need_write = True
else:
    # create a brand new institutional memory aspect
    current_institutional_memory = InstitutionalMemoryClass(

    )
    need_write = True

if need_write:
    event = MetadataChangeProposalWrapper(
        entityUrn=dataset_urn,
        aspect=current_institutional_memory,
    )
    graph.emit(event)
    log.info(f"Link {link_to_add} added to dataset {dataset_urn}")

else:
    log.info(f"Link {link_to_add} already exists and is identical, omitting write")
```

We're using the `MetdataChangeProposalWrapper` to change entities in this example.

## Expected Outcomes
You can now see the description is added to `fct_users_deleted`.

The `drop_missing_first_last_name` should be set to true if you've got many "headless" user LDAP accounts
for devices or services should be excluded when they do not contain a first and last name. This will only
impact the ingestion of LDAP users, while LDAP groups will be unaffected by this config option.

### Configurable LDAP

Every organization may implement LDAP slightly differently based on their needs. The makes a standard LDAP recipe ineffective due to missing data during LDAP ingestion. For instance, LDAP recipe assumes department information for a CorpUser would be present in the `departmentNumber` attribute. If an organization chose not to implement that attribute or rather capture similar imformation in the `department` attribute, that information can be missed during LDAP ingestion (even though the information may be present in LDAP in a slightly different form). LDAP source provides flexibility to provide optional mapping for such variations to be reperesented under attrs_mapping. So if an organization represented `departmentNumber` as `department` and `mail` as `email`, the recipe can be adapted to customize that mapping based on need. An example is show below. If `attrs_mapping` section is not provided, the default mapping will apply.

```yaml
# in config section
attrs_mapping:
  departmentNumber: department
  mail: email
```

# File

Outputs metadata to a file. This can be used to decouple metadata sourcing from the
process of pushing it into DataHub, and is particularly useful for debugging purposes.
Note that the [file source](../source_docs/file.md) can read files generated by this sink.

```yml
sink:
  type: file
  config:
    filename: ./path/to/mce/file.json
```

# File

## Setup

Works with `acryl-datahub` out of the box.

## Capabilities

Outputs metadata to a file. This can be used to decouple metadata sourcing from the
process of pushing it into DataHub, and is particularly useful for debugging purposes.
Note that the [file source](../source_docs/file.md) can read files generated by this sink.

## Quickstart recipe

Use the below recipe to get started with ingestion. See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

```yml
sink:
  type: file
  config:
    filename: ./path/to/mce/file.json
```

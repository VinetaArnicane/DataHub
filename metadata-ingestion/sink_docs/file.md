# File

Outputs metadata to a file. This can be used to decouple metadata sourcing from the
process of pushing it into DataHub, and is particularly useful for debugging purposes.
Note that the file source can read files generated by this sink.

```yml
sink:
  type: file
  config:
    filename: ./path/to/mce/file.json
```

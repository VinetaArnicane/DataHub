# AWS Glue

## Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[glue]'`.

Note: if you also have files in S3 that you'd like to ingest, we recommend you use Glue's built-in data catalog. See [here](../s3-ingestion.md) for a quick guide on how to set up a crawler on Glue and ingest the outputs with DataHub.

## Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- List of tables
- Column types associated with each table
- Table metadata, such as owner, description and parameters
- Jobs and their component transformations, data sources, and data sinks

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

```yml
source:
  type: glue
  config:
    aws_region: "my-aws-region"
```

- Column types associated with each table

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: cassandra
  config:
    ips:
      - ip1
      - ip2
    username: user
    password: pass
    keyspace: keyspace_test
    schema_pattern:
      deny:
        - "system"

sink:
  # sink configs
```

## Config details

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.

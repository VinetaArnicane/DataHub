# Redshift

## Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[redshift]'`.

## Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Databases, schema, and tables and associated metadata
- Column types associated with each table
- Also supports PostGIS extensions

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

```yml
source:
  type: redshift
  config:
    username: user
    password: pass
    host_port: example.something.us-west-2.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439
    database: DemoDatabase

    # Any options specified here will be passed to SQLAlchemy's create_engine as kwargs.
    # See https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html#sqlalchemy.create_engine for details.
    # Many of these options are specific to the underlying database driver, so that library's
    # documentation will be a good reference for what is supported. To find which dialect is likely
    # in use, consult this table: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/dialects/index.html.
    options:
      # driver_option: some-option

    include_views: True # whether to include views, defaults to True
    include_tables: True # whether to include views, defaults to True
```

This requires you to have already installed the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server.

```yml
source:
  type: redshift
  config:
    host_port: my-proxy-hostname:5439

    options:
      connect_args:
        sslmode: "prefer" # or "require" or "verify-ca"
        sslrootcert: ~ # needed to unpin the AWS Redshift certificate
```

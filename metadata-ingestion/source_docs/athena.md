# AWS Athena

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[athena]'`.

This plugin extracts the following:

- List of databases and tables
- Column types associated with each table

```yml
source:
  type: athena
  config:
    username: aws_access_key_id # Optional. If not specified, credentials are picked up according to boto3 rules.
    # See https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html
    password: aws_secret_access_key # Optional.
    database: database # Optional, defaults to "default"

    aws_region: aws_region_name # i.e. "eu-west-1"

    s3_staging_dir: s3_location # "s3://<bucket-name>/prefix/"
    # The s3_staging_dir parameter is needed because Athena always writes query results to S3.
    # See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying.html
    # However, the athena driver will transparently fetch these results as you would expect from any other sql client.

    work_group: athena_workgroup # "primary"

    # Tables to allow/deny. If left blank, will ingest all.
    table_pattern:
      deny:
        # Note that the deny patterns take precedence over the allow patterns.
        - "bad_table"
        - "junk_table"
        # Can also be a regular expression
        - "(old|used|deprecated)_table"
      allow:
        - "good_table"
        - "excellent_table"

    # Although the 'table_pattern' enables you to skip everything from certain schemas,
    # having another option to allow/deny on schema level is an optimization for the case when there is a large number
    # of schemas that one wants to skip and you want to avoid the time to needlessly fetch those tables only to filter
    # them out afterwards via the table_pattern.

    # If left blank, will ingest all.
    schema_pattern:
      deny:
        # ...
      allow:
        # ...

    # Same format as table_pattern, used for filtering views
    view_pattern:
      deny:
        # ...
      allow:
        # ...
```

### Integration Details

<!-- Plain-language description of what this integration is meant to do.  -->
<!-- Include details about where metadata is extracted from (ie. logs, source API, manifest, etc.)   -->

### Prerequisites

In order to ingest metadata from [Source Name], you will need:

- eg. Python version, source version, source access requirements
- eg. Steps to configure source access
- ...

### Concept Mapping

<!-- This should be a manual mapping of concepts from the source to the DataHub Metadata Model -->
<!-- Authors should provide as much context as possible about how this mapping was generated, including assumptions made, known shortcuts, & any other caveats -->

This ingestion source maps the following Source System Concepts to DataHub Concepts:

<!-- Remove all unnecessary/irrelevant DataHub Concepts -->

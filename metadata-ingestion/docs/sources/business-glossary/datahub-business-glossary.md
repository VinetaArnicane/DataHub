### Business Glossary File Format

The business glossary source file should be a .yml file with the following top-level keys:

**Glossary**: the top level keys of the business glossary file

Example **Glossary**:

```yaml
version: "1"                                     			# the version of business glossary file config the config conforms to. Currently the only version released is `1`.
source: DataHub                                			# the source format of the terms. Currently only supports `DataHub`
owners:                                        			# owners contains two nested fields
  users:                                       		    # (optional) a list of user IDs
    - njones
  groups:                                               # (optional) a list of group IDs
    - logistics
url: "https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/"      # (optional) external url pointing to where the glossary is defined externally, if applicable
nodes:                                                  # list of child **GlossaryNode** objects. See **GlossaryNode** section below
	...
```

**GlossaryNode**: a container of **GlossaryNode** and **GlossaryTerm** objects

Example **GlossaryNode**:

```yaml
- name: "Shipping"                                              # name of the node
  id: "Shipping-Logistics"                                      # (optional) custom identifier for the node
  description: Provides terms related to the shipping domain    # description of the node
  owners:                                                       # (optional) owners contains 2 nested fields
    users:                                                      # (optional) a list of user IDs
      - njones
    groups:                                                     # (optional) a  list of group IDs
      - logistics
  nodes:                                                        # list of child **GlossaryNode** objects
    ...
  knowledge_links:                                              # (optional) list of **KnowledgeCard** objects
    - label: Wiki link for shipping
      url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_transport"
```

**GlossaryTerm**: a term in your business glossary

Example **GlossaryTerm**:

```yaml
- name: "Full Address"                                                         # name of the term
  id: "Full-Address-Details"                                                  # (optional) custom identifier for the term
  description: A collection of information to give the location of a building or plot of land.    # description of the term
  owners:                                                                   # (optional) owners contains 2 nested fields
    users:                                                                  # (optional) a list of user IDs
      - njones
    groups:                                                                 # (optional) a  list of group IDs
      - logistics
  term_source: "EXTERNAL"                                                   # one of `EXTERNAL` or `INTERNAL`. Whether the term is coming from an external glossary or one defined in your organization.
  source_ref: FIBO                                                          # (optional) if external, what is the name of the source the glossary term is coming from?

  knowledge_links:                                                          # (optional) a list of **KnowledgeCard** related to this term. These appear as links on the glossary node's page
    - url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address"

```

## ID Management and URL Generation

The business glossary provides two primary ways to manage term and node identifiers:

1. **Custom IDs**: You can explicitly specify an ID for any term or node using the `id` field. This is recommended for terms that need stable, predictable identifiers:
   ```yaml
   terms:
     - name: "Customer Lifetime Value"
       id: "Customer-Lifetime-Value"
       description: "The total revenue expected from a customer"
   ```

2. **Automatic ID Generation**: When no ID is specified, the system will generate one based on the `enable_auto_id` setting:
   - With `enable_auto_id: false` (default):
     - Converts term names to URL-friendly format
     - Replaces spaces with hyphens
     - Removes special characters
     - Preserves case
     - Example: "Customer Lifetime Value" â†’ "Customer-Lifetime-Value"
   - With `enable_auto_id: true`:
     - Generates GUID-based IDs
     - Recommended for guaranteed uniqueness
     - Required for terms with problematic characters that persist after URL cleaning

**Important Notes**:
- Once an ID is created (either manually or automatically), it cannot be easily changed
- All references to a term (in `inherits`, `contains`, etc.) must use its correct ID
- For terms that other terms will reference, consider using explicit IDs
- Using terms with spaces without specifying an ID may affect URL sharing and linking
- The system will automatically handle special characters to create valid URLs

To see how these all work together, check out this comprehensive example business glossary file below:

<summary>Example business glossary file</summary>

```yaml
version: "1"
source: DataHub
owners:
  users:
    - mjames
url: "https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/"
nodes:
  - name: "Data Classification"
    id: "Data-Classification"                    # Custom ID for stable references
    description: A set of terms related to Data Classification
    knowledge_links:
      - label: Wiki link for classification
        url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification"
    terms:
      - name: "Sensitive Data"                   # Will generate: Sensitive-Data
        description: Sensitive Data
        custom_properties:
          is_confidential: "false"
      - name: "Confidential Information"         # Will generate: Confidential-Information
        description: Confidential Data
        custom_properties:
          is_confidential: "true"
  - name: "Personal Information"
    description: All terms related to personal information
    owners:
      users:
        - mjames
    terms:
      - name: "Email Address"
        id: "Email-Contact"                      # Custom ID for this important term
        description: An individual's email address
        inherits:
          - Classification.Confidential
      - name: "Physical Address"                 # Will generate: Physical-Address
        description: A physical address
```

## Compatibility

Compatible with version 1 of business glossary format.
The source will be evolved as we publish newer versions of this format.

## Generating custom IDs for your terms

While IDs are normally generated automatically based on the configuration, you can provide custom IDs for terms and nodes that need stable identifiers. The ID should be unique across the entire Glossary.

Custom IDs can be specified in two ways, both of which are fully supported and acceptable:

1. Just the ID portion (simpler approach):
```yaml
terms:
  - name: "Email"
    id: "company-email"  # Will become urn:li:glossaryTerm:company-email
    description: "Company email address"
```

2. Full URN format:
```yaml
terms:
  - name: "Email"
    id: "urn:li:glossaryTerm:company-email"
    description: "Company email address"
```

Both methods are valid and will work correctly. The system will automatically handle the URN prefix if you specify just the ID portion.

The same applies for nodes:
```yaml
nodes:
  - name: "Communications"
    id: "internal-comms"  # Will become urn:li:glossaryNode:internal-comms
    description: "Internal communication methods"
```

Note: Once you select a custom ID, it cannot be easily changed.

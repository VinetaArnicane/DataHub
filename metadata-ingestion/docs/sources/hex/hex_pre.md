### Prerequisites

#### Authentication

To authenticate with Hex, you will need to provide your Hex API Bearer token.
You can obtain your API key by following the instructions on the [Hex documentation](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/api/api-overview).

Either PAT (Personal Access Token) or Workspace Token can be used as API Bearer token.
If PAT, ingestion will be done with the user's permissions.
If Workspace Token, a read-only token would be enough for ingestion.

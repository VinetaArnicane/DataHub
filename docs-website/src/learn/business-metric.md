# What is a Business Metric and How to Define and Standardize Them

Learn the importance of consistent metric definitions and calculation methods to ensure organizational alignment.

<!--truncate-->

## Introduction

Have you ever been part of a project where different teams had conflicting definitions for key business metrics like revenue or churn? This misalignment can cause significant issues, leading to incorrect analysis and poor decision-making. In this post, we will explore the importance of defining and standardizing business metrics, why it matters, and how you can achieve it effectively within your organization.

## What is Business Metrics Definition and Standardization?

Business metrics definition and standardization involve creating consistent and universally understood definitions for key performance indicators (KPIs) across an organization. Think of it as creating a common language that everyone in your company can use when discussing critical metrics like revenue, churn, or engagement. This ensures that all teams are on the same page, which is essential for accurate analysis and strategic decision-making.

## Why Should You Care About Business Metrics Definition and Standardization?

### The Problem

Data analysts often collaborate with product and finance teams to clarify metrics' conception, calculation methods, and data sources. When there is no consistent understanding of these metrics, it can lead to significant discrepancies in data interpretation and decision-making. Analysts need to ensure that all business-facing metrics use consistent foundational metrics. For example, while a foundational metrics team owns core metrics like revenue and churn, business-facing teams might own engagement metrics. However, they must use the correct definitions for core metrics to analyze the impact of engagement on revenue accurately.

### Importance

For data analysts, standardizing business metrics is crucial because these metrics are direct indicators of the performance and health of various functions within an organization. Standardized metrics provide immediate insight into whether the business is on track to meet its objectives. This standardization is vital for top-level company metrics and often necessary for secondary metrics as well.

### Real-World Impact

Consider a scenario where the finance team defines revenue differently from the product team. If these discrepancies are not reconciled, it could lead to conflicting reports and misguided strategies. For instance, a marketing campaign analyzed with inconsistent metrics might appear successful in one report and unsuccessful in another, causing confusion and potentially leading to incorrect strategic decisions.

## How to Define and Standardize Business Metrics

### General Approach

Start by identifying key business metrics and involve stakeholders from different departments to agree on standard definitions. Document these definitions and ensure they are easily accessible to everyone in the organization. Regular reviews and updates are necessary to keep the metrics relevant and aligned with business goals.

### Alternatives and Best Practices

Some companies try to align metric definitions through emails and meetings. While this can work, it is often inefficient and prone to misunderstandings. Instead, best practices include using a centralized system for defining and accessing business metrics. Implementing approval flows and lineage tracking can ensure that all changes are reviewed and that the origins of each metric are clear.
